=============
Project One

Scope + Concept
	I am planning to build a site for industry professionals in Energy and Natural Resources. This will be a news/analysis website that will allow collaboration and keep the industry apprised of current and future projects. Given the timeline I am planning to include the following features:
	- A user(company representative) will be able register/login and create a posting for the company’s current project in a certain country or on a certain oilfield/mine.
	- User will be able to view other companies’ current projects and leave comments.
	- User will have access to energy/natural resources current news.
	- Users will be able to see statistics on countries, oilfields and mines. (eg. GDP, output, geopolitical status, corruption index, etc)
